## About the project
I created a database of paddleboards and gear -- borrowed from islesurfandsup.com/ --  With that a created a website that is dynamically rendered and responsive to all screen sizes.  To render the paddleboards and accessories data I dynamically rendered page routes using getStaticPaths and getStaticProps.  I used react context to set the initial context of the shopping cart with getServerSideProps and used that context throughtout the application.

NextJS / React / MongoDB / TailwindCSS
